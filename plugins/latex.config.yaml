# meaning of the regex: ^ (start of line), \\(the starting \), .+(any char 1 or more time), $(end)
# first '\\' is recognized as a symbol(half_shape or full_shape). double '\\' make it to be recognized as a pattern
# translator's prefix will consume one '\\'. so user only type once '\' key, only recognize uppercase and lowercase letters, so you can use the number keys to select words.
